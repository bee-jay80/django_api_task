# Django User Authentication System

## 📌 About This Project

This is a **Django REST API Authentication Task** designed to assess students' understanding of:
- Building custom user authentication systems
- Implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) based security
- Creating RESTful API endpoints
- Database modeling and relationships
- Serialization and validation in Django REST Framework

## 🎯 Task Overview

This task requires students to build a complete **user authentication system** using Django and Django REST Framework where:

- Users can **register** with their email, password, and personal information
- Users can **login** and receive JWT tokens (access & refresh tokens)
- Only **authenticated users** can access protected routes
- A **custom user model** extends Django's AbstractBaseUser with additional fields
- A **personalized greeting endpoint** demonstrates business logic based on user data (age eligibility check)
